# House Sales Price Prediction
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.


The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.


Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Conclusions
- Understood how the regularization works in linear, ridge and lasso regressions. Both ridge and lasso have their own reasons to be used for. 
Ridge to be used generally when there are lesser predictors and lasso is highly useful when we want to go for feature selection.
